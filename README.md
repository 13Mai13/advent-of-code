# Advent of Code

[Web](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1). It will be done using uv & python. 

## Notes: 

* Day 3: Greedy algorithm -> They only work for certain problems where local optimal choices lead to a global optimum. It works for the example because when forming numbers not all digits weigth equally, the leftmost position matters most. 
    ```
    Making locally optimal choices (best right now)
    Never reconsidering past decisions
    Never looking ahead to future consequences
    Hoping the local choices lead to a global optimum
    ```
* Day 4: Uses recursiveness -> I solved it with a while True, this can be done much better for sure!

* Day 5: Problem 1 -> My fisrt solution was so inefficient that I couldn't compute it!

* Day 6: Problem 2 -> Was hard because the approach needed to be simplified!

* Day 7: Problem 2 -> Needed to optimize twice!

# Advent of Code

[Web](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1). It will be done using uv & python. 

## Notes: 

* Day 3: Greedy algorithm -> They only work for certain problems where local optimal choices lead to a global optimum. It works for the example because when forming numbers not all digits weigth equally, the leftmost position matters most. 
    ```
    Making locally optimal choices (best right now)
    Never reconsidering past decisions
    Never looking ahead to future consequences
    Hoping the local choices lead to a global optimum
    ```
